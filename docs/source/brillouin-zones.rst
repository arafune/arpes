Brillouin Zones
===============

Some support for calculating and plotting Brillouin zones in PyARPES is
included via `ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/>`__, the Atomic
Simulation Environment. You will need to install ``ase`` as an optional
dependency, for instance via ``pip``, in order to use functions
associated with plotting Brillouin zones in PyARPES.

.. Importantly, PyARPES wraps two functions ``bz2d_plot`` and ``bz3d_plot``
.. from ``ase.dft.bz`` for displaying Brillouin zones in 2 and 3
.. dimensions. These functions include additional functionality to plot
.. additional zones (the ``repeat=`` parameter), to change rendering
.. settings, and to provide a consistent interface with the rest of the
.. plotting utilities in PyARPES.

Plotting ARPES data onto 2D zones
---------------------------------

As an example, we can plot low temperature ARPES data of 2H-NbS2 onto
the appropriate hexagonal Brillouin zone. The data must first be
converted to momentum space, stored here as ``kdata``.

Additional Brillouin zones can be addressed with the
``bz_number``\ parameter.

**Note:** PyARPES does not currently support plotting data onto 3D
Brillouin zones, but we anticipate that this will be supported in future
releases.

Plotting cut locations onto 3D zones
------------------------------------

Frequently it is beneficial to indicate the schematic location of a 2D
arpes cut onto the 3D zone, neglecting the dispersion of **k**\ z in the
case of in-plane momentum maps.

Plotting paths through 2D and 3D zones
--------------------------------------

Paths through zones can also be plotted. PyARPES supports paths defined
by high symmetry points (``G``, ``Y``, ``L``, etc.), as well as the
negatives of these points (as vectors relative to zone center), for
instance ``Gn``. Furthermore, you can access symmetry points in second
and higher zones, with ``K(1, 0, 0)`` in 3D or with ``G(0, 1)`` in two
dimensions, as examples.
