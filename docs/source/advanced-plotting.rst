More advanced plotting techniques in PyARPES
============================================

In addition to the ones discussed previously, certain types of more
complicated plots frequently encountered in ARPES analyses are included
out of the box.

As a general workflow rule of thumb, you can either use these techniques
as a starting point, modifying the axes and objects returned before
saving your figure, or copy the code or technique for a one off figure
that requires more customization.

If you encounter a use case you think should be supported, get in
contact with Conrad and he can add the functionality, or become a
:doc:`contributor </contributing>`.
