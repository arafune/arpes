To Do list Toward 5.0
=====================

Basically, pyarpes should be much simpler package.
As the libraries including ecosystem have been well established.

- Drop PySide6 depend support.
    * I don't feel that QtBased UI is not fitted with the use of Jupyterlab,
      which is de-fact standard python platform for the data analysis.

- UI using holoviews.

- Remove XModelXMixin class for fit_model.

- imfit has been well maintained.
