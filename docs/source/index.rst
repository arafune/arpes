PyARPES
=======
**V4 Release: Non maintainer update**
After V3 release, the origiinal author/maintainer seems to have relinquished maintenance of PyArpes.
While I have posted several pull-requests and comments, but very unfortunately, he have not responded at all.
Furthermore, he does not seems to conduct ARPES related scientific work.
That's would be main reason why he have not maintain it.  There is no motivation to maintain codes those are not used.

And after previous version release, python ecosystem has been improved.  
Conda is not necessarilly the best system, especially for Mac users.
Rather, I believe that it has some adverse effects that tend to cause confusion.
Thus I have decided to drop the conda related.
I strongly recommend to use "rye", instead.

While I have added many type hints in the codes, I still feel that the current package is not so easy to use for the less experienced Python users.
I still recommended igor to analyze, especially to the student. 



**December 2020, V3 Release**: The current relase focuses on improving
usage and workflow for less experienced Python users, lifting version
incompatibilities with dependencies, and ironing out edges in the user
experience.

For the most part, existing users of PyARPES should have no issues
upgrading, but we now require Python 3.8 instead of 3.7. We now provide
a conda environment specification which makes this process simpler, see
the installation notes below. It is recommended that you make a new
environment when you upgrade.

PyARPES is an open-source data analysis library for angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopic (ARPES) research and tool development. While
the scope of what can be achieved with PyARPES is general, PyARPES
focuses on creating a productive programming and analysis environment
for ARPES and its derivatives (Spin-ARPES, ultrafast/Tr-ARPES,
ARPE-microspectroscopy, etc).

As part of this mission, PyARPES aims to reduce the feedback cycle for
scientists between data collection and producing publication quality
analyses and figures. Additionally, PyARPES aims to be a platform on
which new types of ARPES and spectroscopic analyses can be rapidly
prototyped and tested.

For these reasons, PyARPES includes out of the box a **large variety of
analysis tools** for

1.  Applying corrections to ARPES data
2.  Doing gap analysis
3.  Performing sophisticated band analysis
4.  Performing rapid and automated curve fitting, even over several
    dataset dimensions
5.  Background subtraction
6.  Dataset collation and combination
7.  Producing common types of ARPES figures and reference figures
8.  Converting to momentum space
9.  Interactively masking, selecting, laying fits, and exploring data
10. Plotting data onto Brillouin zones

These are in addition to facilities for derivatives, symmetrization, gap
fitting, Fermi-Dirac normalization, the minimum gradient method, and
others. Have a look through the `crash course </how-to>`__ to learn
about supported workflows.

By default, PyARPES supports a variety of data formats from synchrotron
and laser-ARPES sources including ARPES at the Advanced Light Source
(ALS), the data produced by Scienta Omicron GmbH’s “SES Wrapper”, data
and experiment files from Igor Pro (see in particular the section on
`importing Igor Data </igor-pro>`__), NeXuS files, and others.
Additional data formats can be added via a user plugin system.

If PyARPES helps you in preparing a conference presentation or
publication, please respect the guidelines for citation laid out in the
notes on `user contribution </contributing>`__. Contributions and
suggestions from the community are also welcomed warmly.

Tool Development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Secondary to providing a healthy and sane analysis environment, PyARPES
is a testbed for new analysis and correction techniques, and as such
ships with ``scikit-learn`` and ``open-cv`` as compatible dependencies
for machine learning. ``cvxpy`` can also be included for convex
optimization tools.
