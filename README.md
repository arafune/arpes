# PyARPES

![image](docs/source/_static/video/intro-video.gif)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

PyARPES simplifies the analysis and collection of angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and emphasizes

-   modern, best practices for data science
-   support for a standard library of ARPES analysis tools mirroring
    those available in Igor Pro
-   interactive and extensible analysis tools

It supports a variety of data formats from synchrotron and laser-ARPES
sources including ARPES at the Advanced Light Source (ALS), the data
produced by Scienta Omicron GmbH\'s \"SES Wrapper\", data and experiment
files from Igor Pro, NeXuS files, and others.

To learn more about installing and using PyARPES in your analysis or
data collection application, visit [the documentation
site](https://arpes.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

PyARPES is currently developed by Conrad Stansbury of the Lanzara Group
at the University of California, Berkeley.

## Citing PyARPES

If you use PyARPES in your work, please support the development of
scientific software by acknowledging its usefulness to you with a
citation. The simplest way to do this is to cite the paper describing
the package in SoftwareX

> \@article{
>
> :   stansburypyarpes, title = {PyARPES: An analysis framework for
>     multimodal angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopies}, journal =

# Installation

PyARPES can be installed from source, or using either `pip` or `conda`
into a Python 3.6 or 3.7 environment. `conda` is preferred as a package
manager in order to facilitate installing the libraries for reading HDF
and NetCDF files.

## Pip installation

    pip install arpes

## Conda installation

PyARPES is distributed through the `arpes` Anaconda channel, but
includes dependencies through `conda-forge`. Please make sure not to put
conda-forge above the main channel priority, as this can cause issues
with installing BLAS. A minimal install looks like

    conda config --append channels conda-forge
    conda install -c arpes -c conda-forge arpes

## Local installation from source

If you want to modify the source for PyARPES as you use it, you might
prefer a local installation from source. Details can be found on [the
documentation site](https://arpes.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

## Suggested steps

1.  Clone or duplicate the folder structure in the repository
    `arpes-analysis-scaffold`, skipping the example folder and data if
    you like
2.  Install and configure standard tools like
    [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) or Jupyter Lab. Notes on installing
    and configuring Jupyter based installations can be found in
    `jupyter.md`
3.  Explore the documentation and example notebooks at [the
    documentation site](https://arpes.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

# Contact

Questions, difficulties, and suggestions can be directed to Conrad
Stansbury (<chstan@berkeley.edu>) or added to the repository as an
issue. In the case of trouble, also check the
