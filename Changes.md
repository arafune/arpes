Major Changes from 3.0.1

- Introdcue a new attrs, "energy_notation" is introduced, which determines eithe "Kinetic" energy or "Binding" energy
  - Add new method: S.switch_energy_notation(self, nonlinear_order=1)
- Use correct method to convert from the angle to mthe omentum. (Original approach was found to be incorrect)
- filters.boxcar: skip_nan has been removed
- Dataset.S.spectra returns the list of the xr.DataArrays whose dims contains "eV". (See xarray_extensions.py)
- Provide SPD_main.py & prodigy_itx.py
- Add a new method S.swap_angle_unit() to change the angle unit (deg <-> radian)
- Do not carelessly set deafult=None

- Replace algorithms to make them simpler and more efficient

  - stack_plot.py/flat_stack_plot
  - analysis/general.py/rebin

- Removing

  - Remove arpes.all

    - Certainly, this it is indeed a lazy and carefree approach, but it's too rough method that leads to a bugs and does not mathc the current pythonic style.

  - Remove utilities/attrs.py

    - The functions in this module have not been used and are unlikely to be used in the future.

  - modules that use the Bokeh.

    There is a dependency problem among bokeh, tornard, and Jupyter, which I cannot fix because I'm haven't use Bokeh.

    - arpes/plotting/band_tool.py
    - arpes/plotting/curvature_tool.py
    - arpes/plotting/fit_inspection_tool.py
    - arpes/plotting/comparison_tool.py
    - arpes/plotting/dyn_tool.py
    - arpes/plotting/interactive_utils.py
    - arpes/plotting/interactive.py
    - arpes/plotting/path_tool.py
    - arpes/plotting/mask_tool.py

  - Remove overlapped_stack_dispersion_plot
    - use stack_dispersion_plot with appropriate args
  - Remove G.extent in xarray_extensions, which is not so usuful
  - Remove scan_row property

Fix from 3.0.1

- bug of concatenating in broadcast_model
- Import error in BZ plotting example #7

Minor Changes from 3.0.1

- Remove beta arg from filters.curvature
